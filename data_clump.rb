#Data Clump

> A data clump happens when you have a pair of arguments, at least two, that you are passing together all the time;
> a test to identify a data clump is if you remove one argument the another one make kind of sense? 
> So the arguments have an implicit relation.

> A way to solve this smell is extract an object with the arguments.
